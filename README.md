# Reed rack
This repository hosts parametric 3D models of reed racks for oboe, bassoon, and English horn reeds. The models are built using [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) and intended for 3D printing.


## Types

### Recessed reed rack

The recessed reed rack holds reeds by recessed holes. This type of rack is easy to store and carry, but it does not support bassoon reeds. See `recessed_reed_rack.scad`.
